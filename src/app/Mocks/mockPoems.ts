          Listen to my hopes and dreams
          Give me your attention 
          Listen for the in-betweens 
          
          Show me all the parts of you
          The broken pieces too 
          Give me what you want the most
          I’ll give it back to you
          
          Never let me guess your  dreams 
          I need to feel you there 
          I’ll never judge your inner thoughts 
          I’ll wipe away your fears 
          
          I long to feel the closeness 
          I long to to catch my breath 
          I long to be together 
          Even after death 
          
          I suffer through my yearnings 
          I won’t forsake my heart 
          I wonder and I wonder 
          Who will ever do their part 
          
          There has to be a reason 
          There has to be a plan 
          Who has God created 
          That should consummate this man 
          
          This man has been mistaken 
          This man is still unsure 
          This heart is true and hopeful 
          this life holds something more 
          
          I put my faith in forces 
          That can clarify my soul 
          But lost a piece of innocence 
          In haste to reach that goal 
          
          For future altercations 
          For those who seek to try 
          I hold my heart in high esteem
          You need not ask me why 
          
          I’ll open up this window 
          But you must pay the toll 
          I’ll open up my heart to you 
          Just listen to my soul-

          (a song)
    
    Everybody wants to be in love
    It seems so easy to do
    You see a smile, then you say a few lines 
    But that don’t make it come true 
    You played the games and you said the right words 
    You tried to keep it alive
    But don’t ya’ know that a feeling like that 
    Has gotta” come down from derp inside ..
    
    Chorus:
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ make the love 
    It’s gotta’ come from inside 
    It’s gotta” come from above 
    You gotta” make the love 
    
    I remember the days back when I was in school
    I used to use those lines 
    A pretty face with some music on 
    I saw it all the time 
    some beer and a song on a hot summer night 
    But, there’s always more you need to do
    There’s more to love than  
    a hungry heart 
    You gotta’ make it come true 
    
    chorus:
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ put in the time 
    Put some reason to rhyme 
    You gotta’ make the love

    Where’s my day dream 
    Where’s my passion 
    Where’s the cloths I wore in fashion 
    ...Where’s   the   dreams   
    I   thought   we   made   come   true .....
    Where   am    I .....
    Where    are   You....
    
    We gotta’ make the love
    We gotta’ make this love 
    We need to see this through 
    It’s up to me and you 
    We need to make this love 
    
    Make the love .......
    We gotta’ make the love 
    We gotta’ take what we’ve got 
    We’ve gotta’ give  it a shot 
    We gotta’ make this love 
    
    Make the love ....
    Make it last .....
    Save this love....
    Don’t move so fast ....
    Savor this love.....
    Fall deep in this love....
    I believe in this love.....
    
    *FADE
    ....Make the love, we gotta’ save this love
    ....this one true love 
    ...we gotta’ save this love, 
    We gotta’ make this love
    *FADE OUT
