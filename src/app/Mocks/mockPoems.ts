          Listen to my hopes and dreams
          Give me your attention 
          Listen for the in-betweens 
          
          Show me all the parts of you
          The broken pieces too 
          Give me what you want the most
          I’ll give it back to you
          
          Never let me guess your  dreams 
          I need to feel you there 
          I’ll never judge your inner thoughts 
          I’ll wipe away your fears 
          
          I long to feel the closeness 
          I long to to catch my breath 
          I long to be together 
          Even after death 
          
          I suffer through my yearnings 
          I won’t forsake my heart 
          I wonder and I wonder 
          Who will ever do their part 
          
          There has to be a reason 
          There has to be a plan 
          Who has God created 
          That should consummate this man 
          
          This man has been mistaken 
          This man is still unsure 
          This heart is true and hopeful 
          this life holds something more 
          
          I put my faith in forces 
          That can clarify my soul 
          But lost a piece of innocence 
          In haste to reach that goal 
          
          For future altercations 
          For those who seek to try 
          I hold my heart in high esteem
          You need not ask me why 
          
          I’ll open up this window 
          But you must pay the toll 
          I’ll open up my heart to you 
          Just listen to my soul-

          (a song)
    
    Everybody wants to be in love
    It seems so easy to do
    You see a smile, then you say a few lines 
    But that don’t make it come true 
    You played the games and you said the right words 
    You tried to keep it alive
    But don’t ya’ know that a feeling like that 
    Has gotta” come down from derp inside ..
    
    Chorus:
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ make the love 
    It’s gotta’ come from inside 
    It’s gotta” come from above 
    You gotta” make the love 
    
    I remember the days back when I was in school
    I used to use those lines 
    A pretty face with some music on 
    I saw it all the time 
    some beer and a song on a hot summer night 
    But, there’s always more you need to do
    There’s more to love than  
    a hungry heart 
    You gotta’ make it come true 
    
    chorus:
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ put in the time 
    Put some reason to rhyme 
    You gotta’ make the love

    Where’s my day dream 
    Where’s my passion 
    Where’s the cloths I wore in fashion 
    ...Where’s   the   dreams   
    I   thought   we   made   come   true .....
    Where   am    I .....
    Where    are   You....
    
    We gotta’ make the love
    We gotta’ make this love 
    We need to see this through 
    It’s up to me and you 
    We need to make this love 
    
    Make the love .......
    We gotta’ make the love 
    We gotta’ take what we’ve got 
    We’ve gotta’ give  it a shot 
    We gotta’ make this love 
    
    Make the love ....
    Make it last .....
    Save this love....
    Don’t move so fast ....
    Savor this love.....
    Fall deep in this love....

    "text": `Why did I have to be  head over heels
  Before they could ever know  just how it feels
  My heart was so heavy and ready to quit 
  But I held on to life with a vengeance and grit 
  
  I held in the pain from all of those years 
  But the dam had to break as it held back the tears 
  I felt loose and flimsy, my thoughts went astray 
  But I gathered my strength and To God I would pray
  
  I did what I had to and some things were wrong 
  I made my mistakes as the time seemed so long 
  I held and I held and I didn't let go 
  I had only my smile to the world I could show 
  
  It's all how you view things and yo go with the flow
  Your attitude dictates how far you will go
  It's all in your heart and all how you think 
  That makes you to swim or that makes you to sink 
  
  I'm back in the ring, and my worries are light 
  My gloves are back on and I'm still in the fight 
  I've learned to take punches and to get right back up
  And to know it's half full when I look in my cup-

    "title": "Felony", "text": `Six felony rising 
  But I committed no crime
  They put the noose around me
  They tried to cut my vine
  
  This town is so wicked
  These people are so cruel 
  Evil pours from this spigot
  No justice to rule 
  
  The judgment presiding
  So corrupt and unfair
  No conscience or feelings
  Sit high on that chair
  
  Tempered by greed 
  and ruled with distain 
  They hijacked my spirit 
  And ruined my name 
  
  Down on my luck 
  And fretting in pain 
  They kicked me and laughed 
  To further their name 
  
  They lied and they plotted 
  They trampled my rights 
  With false accusations
  Strategically placed knives
  
  They misplaced the facts 
  While hiding the truth
  They kept the rotten caucasus
  They pulled the healthy tooth
  
  They put it in print 
  For the whole world to see
  The lies and wisted truth 
  From the powers that be 
  
  They ram sacked my possessions
  So anxious and scared 
  Such despair i never felt before 
  A million times squared 
  
  I was going through changes 
  When this facade came to be
  A family dismantled 
  Like the guts inside me 
  
  Such doubt in my mind
  And my own family tree
  I clenched tight to my faith 
  As the cuffs did to me 
  
  She smiled to herself 
  As they gave her a pass 
  I clung to my faith 
  As she clung to her glass 
  
  The one who once loved me 
  Now wants me to sink 
  She watched in delight 
  Holding onto her drink 
  
  But I trusted in He, 
  who had been there back when
  As my own counsel betrayed me and gave me to them 
  
  Somehow I got through it
  The panic and pain
  They burnt down my house 
  and they tarnished my name
  
  The patrons I lost 
  The doubt that remained 
  The love that I lost 
  and the hurt I sustained 
  
  Betrayed and sold out 
  For money and fame
  For position and favor 
  They ruined my name 
  
  I built myself back
  I paid fees, so unfair
  But then miracles came
  Right out of thin air
  
  The truth came out yelling 
  Right into their ear 
  For those who had sight 
  And for those who would hear 
  
  The ones who stood laughing 
  Dropped down to their knees 
  As I humbly gathered 
  the homey from bees 
  
  The pain I endured 
  sadness I had to weather
  Seems distant and weak 
  On this couch made of leather 
  
  Some of the villains
  Who seemed to escape 
  From the long hands of justice 
  And the hero’s long cape 
  
  I cannot worry 
  It’s not mine to begrudge 
  I need not waste tine 
  Or to trudge through the sludge 
  
  Though things seemed so bad and no hope could  be found
  It’s so funny how quickly
  that things turn around
  
  When you’re chopping that tree with that axe in your hand
  The fatigue that you feel 
  no one else can understand
  
  Sometimes It seems like forever 
  as you wait for the bell to ring 
  Sometimes it’s hard to know 
  That it falls with one more swing
  
  Sometimes it’s hard to believe
  As we struggle through these days 
  God doesn’t pay every Saturday  night
  But believe me, He pays-

    You don’t owe me 
    You don’t own me 
    you don’t even know me 
    I learned a lot of lessons the hard way and not exactly what I would call Fair play sometimes my dreams seemed closer than I could possibly imagine 
    but that’s when I believed in Puff the Magic Dragon,
    PETER PAN &
    DISNEY LAND
    and when  I had a little red wagon 
    other times my dreams seem further away than a constellation 
    CRAZY ANTICIPATION
    Feel like I forgot my bags down at the station 
    For a long time i used to check myself and even gave up respect for myself 
    when I had to keep everybody happy and not say what’s really on my mind 
    but those days are long gone because my mind is spot on 
    and I don’t need a magic Wond 
    I don’t have to be don juan to charm people like a snake out of the basket 
    and I don’t need a hammer & nails to put haters in a casket
     I only answered because you asked it you can stretch me out all you want,
    im elastic  
    Mr. fantastic 
    But I’m no action figure made of plastic I’m made from the school of hard knocks I showed up for the screen call because you cast it 
    you forced me into this role 
    I NEVER ASKED IT 
    I never wanted to be cynical
    The milestones in my life were all pinnacle
    Don’t get me wrong 
    there’s some things that I would change
     but there’s some things that I just had to do my way 
    regardless of what all my critics had to say 
    I went through some hard times but somebody up there obviously likes  me out there in space 
    Yeah, there  were times when I fell on my face 
    but 
    most of the time, I got to home base 
    Take a look at my face 
    You may see what you wana see
    But most people just see first place 
    some people dont really get it ,
    But it’ll sink in if you just let it 
    Sometimes I let shit go on longer than i should 
    But that’s because I could 
    If I could do it all over again, 
    I don’t know if I would
    It’s true, I put up the gloves  with a few major opponents 
    and I’ve been detained by a couple of guys with a bag of donuts 
    sure enough, it kind of hurt my pride 
    kind of made me feel small inside 
    but that’s when I knew that it was time for me to rise 
    And all that chitter-chatter really came as no surprise 
    Neither did the lies 
    I had to come to terms with 
    all the knives in my back and people I could never take back 
    A few people stood by my side,
    they knew who I really was deep down inside 
    They knew it was gona be a bumpy ride 
    So they fastened they’re seat belts and held onto my arm 
    They never worried about the airbag or called State Farm 
    They told me not to  bow down to all of those people tryin’ to break my stride 
    It was comforting to know, 
    But I still felt sick inside 
    And I have to admit that most of the time, it was just my pride 
    money and pride can suck you dry 
    the deepest vortex , 
    The highest tide 
    sucked into thinking that people’s opinion of me was like a the bee to the honey 
    and I trusted  people that never even offered me a tissue when my nose was cold and runny 
    yeah, I know that sounds funny ...
    But sittin’ in the back of the wagon in cuffs and shackles 
    Ain’t like  being on the French riviera with wine -n- crackers 
    I begged for reprieve as my feelings went numb 
    I hoped for a vision but 
    never got one 
    Spring was in the air and cash was in the judges pocket 
    He got Pre-approved by somebody, 
    but it wasn’t Bank of America or rocket 
    Somebody’s arm got pulled outta the socket 
    What ever happened to Johnny Appleseed , Superman and Davy Crockett 
     There  was no justice on that docket 
    Plenty of freedom for sale 
    But that courthouse just didn’t seem to stock it 
    What can I say,
    That shit happens every day 
    I know despite it all that God loves me anyway 
    Now I understand what they say ...
    How He works in a strange and mysterious way 
    But it’s ok 
    He’s still holding my hand
    Footprints in the sand 
    and I never plan on strayin’ away 
    It’s all a game, but I still got my hand in play 
    So I’ll see you when I’m walking done the block 
    Then you’ll  see me sittin’ at the top 
    You saw me when I was wearing nothin but a smock 
    Now that same smock is in the hamper with an old sock, 
    as a reminder
    That you could have  been much kinder 
    when my ass was Fallin” straight into the grinder 
    But you know what they say ...
    All is well that ends well 
    it’s the end for you 
    and I’m back from hell
    The look on your face seems like you just woke up from  a spell
    Seeing me on the comeback trail 
    And I can still take it up another notch 
    You  never did get to own me,
    But you get to watch.

    You know, down deep, the fear was fake 
    
    Fear’s the reason that you fell 
    Pride is why you had to fall 
    You thought the sadness was all leaning
    But then nothing changed at all
    
    You thought you’d loose the pain 
    You thought you’d have control 
    You gave up everything you had 
    Now, don’t give up your  soul

    I feel the stitches 
    I sense the demons 
    spirits and witches 
    I feel the elephant 
    Flat on my chest 
    I miss the feelings 
    That I can’t express 
    I feel my feet 
    So heavy like stone 
    I feel my freedom 
    Down deep to the bone 
    I feel the plastic bag 
    Over my head 
    This is mere tyranny
    I feel half dead 
    I keep my eyes open 
    That’s why they’re so red
    I have no bakes 
    On this broken down sled 
    I can’t call grandma 
    I can’t cry out 
    I can’t feel sympathy 
    I can’t feel doubt 
    I see no reprise 
    from this spot that I’m in 
    So I will check out 
    From this broken down inn
    I feel myself fading 
    I feel myself spin 
    I must escape from
    This quicksand I’m in 
    I dream of my freedom 
    I gasp for a breath 
    I tried and you lied 
    Now I have nothing left 
    I feel no remorse 
    I only feel shame 
    That I tried to win out
    From this rigged, losing  game 
    I’m not a watch or wallet or ring 
    I want to be loved for the love that I bring 
    Enough is enough 
    The going is rough 
    So I will get going 
    I’ve broken the cuff 
    I’m not a possession 
    For you to obsess 
    You need to let go 
    Cause’ you are possessed

    You struck the matches 
    
    Drops of  my blood 
    Deep from the scratches
    Blinding my vision 
    Drips off my lashes  
    
    Sobering  glances 
    Smiles from a script 
    Clueless advances 
    Sip after sip 
    
    Drip after drip 
    Trip after trip 
    Meaningless letters 
    Rip after rip 
    
    Chance after chance
    Call after call 
    Chance to escape 
    Calls from the law 
    
    Screams in the night
    holes in the wall 
    Schemes that you’d write 
    I remember them all 
    
    We once had it all 
    We once had a ball 
    You once stood for something 
    you once stood up tall 
    
    You once were the fire

    now your just ashes

    When my eyes were not so fixed

    While I let you play your tricks 
    Don’t ask me why I let you 
    I think that I was bored 
    Recouping from a let down 
    My adrenaline was lured 
    I tried to entice your vision 
    I tried to tempt your heart
    I tried to show you who I am
    But I knew it from the start 
    Your sight was dull and  fuzzy your heart was hard and cold 
    Your makeup done so flawlessly 
    A wreck less, careless soul 
    Your bitter-sweet demeanor
    So cunning and unclear 
    I only have myself to blame 
    Allowing you so near 
    I think back when we started 
    My caution to the wind 
    Allowed my thoughts to render me 
    regrets I can’t rescind 
    I blame myself completely 
    I, alone had made that choice 
    But now I can be free from you 
    Now I can rejoice

    Why are my eyes still open wide 
    How do I try so hard
    when I’m so tender inside 
    I feel like I’m on stage 
    People pointing out mistakes 
    Not on the same page 
    They don’t know the effort it takes 
    Again, why do I care 
    why do i do it 
    Why can’t I stop
    Why do I put myself through it 
    The energy keeps coming 
    The vibrations don’t ever stop 
    I feel like I’m looking down from so far away 
    It’s lonely at the top 
    Is up down 
    Is down up 
    Am I full of myself 
    Am I just an empty cup 
    Why do I even give it thought 
    Why do I keep coming back from the emotional bashing
    Are there no lessons learned 
    Why do I watch the pumpkins smashing,
    feel  the verbal thrashing,
    go through the mental rehashing, 
    the emotional unmasking,
    the heart’s breaking and the  spirits crashing
    I don’t know why 
    I don’t know how 
    I can throw out the tears 
    but not throw in the towel 
    Please give me the reason
    I try and I try 
    Because I don’t know how and

    There is no control

    You posses the key to all your happiness 
    You can turn your guilt and shame to stone 
    You can live you dreams through all eternity

    You can only see the vision when your walking in the light 
    so that you can see the forces that surround you 
    You cant see the pathway when your  eyes are closed so tight
    you can’t see the love that’s  all around you 
    
    Let me see your laughter in the sunlight 
    Tell me where you are so I can find you 
    Open up your mind so I can see just who you are 
    Let me break the chains of hurt that bind you 
    
    I know you dream of sunsets 
    and to find yourself again 
    I know your heart is aching and I know you need a friend 
    These moments leave so quickly when you see a bit of light 
    These are times your pray to God and try with all your might

    how we beg to be free 
    Incubus around us that we 
    don’t want to see
    Succubus temptress 
    compel our vanity 
    Prideful visions 
    blinding our sanity 
    Pushing the limits 
    feelings surreal  
    Then wanting to run 
    from the pain that we feel 
    Our lips once in silence 
    now move in prayer 
    Desperate to loose 
    what we once wanted there 
    Youth in its folly 
    age in its might 
    We laugh in the day 
    then cry in the night 
    Wise is the man 
    who clings to the light 
    He knows what is wrong 
    he does what is right 
    visions and pains 
    we want to forget 
    Are from things that we saw 
    that we knew we’d regret 
    There is no regret 
    when there is no pain
    But flesh ages quickly 
    as we stroll down the lane 
    Arrogance is the root of the thorn of regret
    humility reaches where our pride cannot get 
    Hearts that are joyous 
    seek truth in the light 
    It walks with no fear 
    it loves what is right 
    But a heart that is hardened 
    that refuses to hark 
    Will crumble in pain 
    blind in the dark-

    "text":`Wind rushes into my face,
    I try to escape from this place. 
   Precious and few are the moments of reprieve,
   ￼ my plans to escape,
   embossed on my sleeve.￼￼
   Memories written, 
   about the places i’ve been bitten.
   Words ignored ,feelings betrayed 
   trust gone, a heart smitten.
   Thoughts running  faster than time can take me.
   My smile pleads for redemption
   but my lips forsake me.
   Advice given over the ages.
   Red flags, red lights ,red eyes 
   wise sages.
   Decisions in haste, wasted nights in white lace.
   Black hearts, white lies and watermarks all over the pages.
   Choices I’ve made that I thought were courageous.
   I look back now and see the folly of my trust in pretentious behaviors.
   Hopes of changing things and pulling strings.
   Sometimes the voice is not from the one who sings and we are no saviors.
   A true heart and a broken wing seeks to be mended, 
   but an angel with no wings has only the flights that she has pretended.
   I’m a little tired of giving free passes and pieces of my heart that I’ve lended,
   so, if I seem a little distant,
   please don’t be offended.
   There’s just these old messages
   that I can no longer be sending.
   There’s just these recipes and combinations with people that I can no longer be blending.
   There’s just a lotta’ rotten schemes and twisted plots that I can no longer be defending.
   I gotta’ defend my own ,stay in my zone, delete these these old pictures outta’ my phone to make sure there’s a happy ending.
   Did you say you wanna’ talk about making a plan,
   then, your gonna’ need a passport, a credit check and a full body scan.
   Please wait till’ I put on a hat and some sunscreen.
   Last time I got a little more than just a tan.
   Last time I shoulda’ just stayed in the frying pan.
   Fire burns, but I gotta’ give her a hand.
   The label was clever, but I shoulda’ asked what was in the can.
   I shoulda’ checked the coordinates so I knew where I was gona’ land.
   The landing was not as smooth as the lies that left me grounded.
   The cries and the blame were  not as silent as the bells that should have sounded.
   The edges were sharper than her promises to be rounded.
   Useless words and dreams here
   bonded.
   Senses bound the pages’ meanings.
   She already knows the tears that rip the bindings apart.
    So, I won’t write another word,
   In the memoirs of my heart.

    Everybody wants to be in love
    It seems so easy to do
    You see a smile, then you say a few lines 
    But that don’t make it come true 
    You played the games and you said the right words 
    You tried to keep it alive
    But don’t ya’ know that a feeling like that 
    Has gotta” come down from derp inside ..
    
    Chorus:
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ make the love 
    It’s gotta’ come from inside 
    It’s gotta” come from above 
    You gotta” make the love 
    
    I remember the days back when I was in school
    I used to use those lines 
    A pretty face with some music on 
    I saw it all the time 
    some beer and a song on a hot summer night 
    But, there’s always more you need to do
    There’s more to love than  
    a hungry heart 
    You gotta’ make it come true 
    
    chorus:
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ make the love 
    You gotta’ put in the time 
    Put some reason to rhyme 
    You gotta’ make the love
